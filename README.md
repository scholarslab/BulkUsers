# BulkUsers

A simple way to add a bunch of users at once.

1. Install the plugin.
2. Navigate to admin/bulk-users in the Omeka admin panel.
3. Add a bunch of emails, separated by a single line.
4. Choose a role for all your new users.
5. Hit submit. Users should get an activation email from your Omeka
   instance once their user is created.

A username will be generated based on the local part of the email (the
part before the "@"). Omeka has character restrictions for user
names—only alphanumeric characters are allowed—so some emails may not 
work with this plugin.
